# FSharpLunchNLearn

## Goals / Motivation

- Learn F# by building a web app from scratch
- Interested more on the App Dev side of F# and less on Domain Modeling / Functional Programming in F# (lots of resources for this)
- [F# Web Dev](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/scenarios/web-development)

## Why F#?

- Looking to learn a new language while still building my understanding of DDD and .NET
- Can utilize the .NET ecosystem which I already am familiar with
- Functional Programming is a different way of thinking about problems. Learn different set of best practices and patterns
- A lot of the concepts in F# are being ported to C# (Pattern Matching, Records, etc) so deepen C# understanding as well
- Definitely not learning VB.NET ðŸ’€
- Have fun! ðŸŽ‰

## Introduction

## Time to look at some code!

### Domain Modeling Made Functional

### 1 - Initialize new F# Web App

```bash
dotnet new web -lang F# -o FSharpWebApp
```
